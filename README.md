# Welcome to Project #1: The Game

## About me
I am a former Brazilian/Italian interior designer, living in Dublin, Ireland, that recently decided to start to give my first steps towards a career change by attending a Bootcamp at Ironhack.

## About the game
This short quiz game was created to test the user acknowledgement of the Web Development subject, as well as to practice the new skills acquired during the first two weeks of the Bootcamp at Ironhac.

## How to play
To play, the user needs to click the START GAME button, which leads to the first question, which contains four options as answers, being just one correct.

The game gives three lives for the player, which decreases as wrong answers are chosen.

The player wins when all the correct answers are chosen (nine in total), and loses when there are no longer lives left.
