# Quiz Game

## About me 🙋🏻‍♂️
I am a former Brazilian/Italian interior designer living in Dublin, Ireland, who decided to take my first steps toward a career change by attending a Bootcamp at Ironhack.

## About the game 💭
This is my first ever project created using CSS, HTML and JavaScript.
The game was created to test the user's knowledge of the Web Development subject and to practice the new skills acquired during the first two weeks of the Bootcamp at Ironhack.

## How to play? 🤔
To play, the user needs to click the START GAME button, which leads to the first question, which contains four options as answers, just one correct.

The game gives the player three lives, decreasing as wrong answers are chosen.

The player wins when all the correct answers are chosen (nine in total) and loses when no longer lives are left.
